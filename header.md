# Music Projection Ontology

The [Music Projection Ontology](https://github.com/polifonia-project/music-projection-ontology) allows the formalisation of the musical entities that can be the subject of an annotations. 
This ranges from traditional musical notation (e.g. note, chords) to informal annotations (e.g. mood, danceability).
