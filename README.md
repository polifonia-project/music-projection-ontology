The Music Projection module formalises musical entities that can be subject of an annotation. This ranges from traditional musical notation (e.g. note, chords) to informal annotations (e.g. mood, danceability). The module is aligned with MusicOWL, Music Notation Ontology, Music Note Ontology, Music Theory Ontology [1], Chord Ontology [2], and our [`Roman Chord`](https://github.com/polifonia-project/roman-chord-ontology) Ontology. This allows to integrate existing domain ontologies. Notably, we also harmonise different chord representations (Chord Ontology, the Roman Chord Ontology and the Tonality Ontology) based on the Unified Model of Chords in Western Harmony [3].
