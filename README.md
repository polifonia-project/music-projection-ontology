The Music Projection Ontology allows the formalisation of the musical entities that can be the subject of an annotations. 
This ranges from traditional musical notation (e.g. note, chords) to informal annotations (e.g. mood, danceability).

### General projections
A set of general concepts has been identified. Those are then extended by other modules which model a specific interepretation of a concept.
That is because some projections, for instance the concept of *Mode*, changes when interpreted using modern western music theory or thories from the reinassance.
The general definition of a projection allows flexible extensions while retaining a fundamental alignment that allows different theories to be interoperable.

This ontology is hence provides the ground work for an upper ontology on music concepts that can be of interest from an analytical point of view. It is exprected to grow as more specialisation are produced.

![General set of concepts](diagrams/main_concepts.png "General set of concepts")

In the Figure above the main set of concepts that are more commonly extended by other ontologies are represented.
The definition of Note, PitchClass and Interval is an implementation of the model defined in [7].
A graphical representation is depicted below.

![Projections specification](diagrams/projections_definition.png "Projections definition")

The expressivity of OWL allows the formalisation of the relation between a pitch class and an interval, as restrictions. In in the Figure below the restrictions are depicted. An in-depth explanation is given in [7].

## Competency questions addressed
The ontology follows the [eXtreme Design](http://extremedesign.info/) methodology for ontology development. A set of competency questions have been extracted from similar works and are listed below, alongside their provenance.

| ID | Competency question                                                                                       | Reference               |
|----|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 1  | What are the dynamic indications referring to a note in the score?                                        | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 2  | Which are the accidental of the notes present in a score part?                                            | Music Note Ontology [4] |
| 3  | Which are the compositions containing chords composed of X notes?                                         | MusicOWL [2]            |
